# Day 3 - 100 Days of Code : Concatenation

# Concatenation can be referred as simply gluing the text with
# the variables

myName = input("What is your Name?: ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for Lunch?: ")
print(myName,"is going to be chowing down on",myLunch,"very soon")



# Common Coding Errors

# yourName = input("Name: ")
# WhatYear = input("What year is it?: ")
# print(yourName "thinks it is " WhatYear)
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?

# Do remember the comma or simply the syntax of concatenation


# Day 3 Challenge 

# Solution
