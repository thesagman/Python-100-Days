# Day 1 - 100 Days of Code : Print and was mostly about Replit Workspace


print('Hello Replit') 
# Everything in the quotes is text, also called a String

print("and how are you?")
print("ðŸ¤—")


print("""
     Here's
     an 
     exact
     way 
     i 
     wrote
     the
     code
      """)

# Thats what those three Quotes do


# Common Coding Errors

1.  # Print("What could go wrong?")
    # NameError: name 'Print' is not defined. Did you mean: 'print'?


2.  # print "Hello World"
    # SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?
    
    
# Fixed my Code

print("What could go wrong?")
print("Hello World")


# print(Please Work)

# Note :- The Solution to the this problem is 
#         about the syntax as the strings or 
#         something you wanna print as it is should be under the quotes
#         doesnt matter whether it is single or double quotes

# Solution
print("Please Work")

I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python
challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do 
this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses 
for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling ðŸ¥³
